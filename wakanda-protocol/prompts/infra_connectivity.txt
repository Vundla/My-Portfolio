Design a comprehensive, resilient infrastructure plan to connect government facilities and citizens across South Africa:

1. **Connectivity Strategy**:
   - Last-mile connectivity options (fiber, wireless, satellite)
   - Leveraging SA Connect backbone infrastructure
   - Municipal and provincial network integration
   - Rural and underserved area solutions
   - Redundancy and failover mechanisms

2. **Cloud and Hosting Architecture**:
   - Hybrid cloud strategy (public, private, community clouds)
   - Edge computing nodes for improved latency
   - Content delivery networks (CDN) for static content
   - Disaster recovery and business continuity
   - Data sovereignty and localization requirements

3. **Network Security and Performance**:
   - Zero Trust network architecture implementation
   - Bandwidth budgeting and traffic management
   - Quality of Service (QoS) prioritization
   - Network monitoring and optimization
   - Cybersecurity controls and incident response

4. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform
   - Container orchestration with Kubernetes
   - API gateway and service mesh architecture
   - Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)
   - Automated deployment and CI/CD pipelines

5. **Capacity Planning**:
   - Current and projected usage patterns
   - Scalability and elasticity requirements
   - Performance benchmarks and SLAs
   - Cost optimization strategies
   - Green IT and sustainability considerations

Include specific recommendations for leveraging state entities like SITA and Sentech for implementation.
