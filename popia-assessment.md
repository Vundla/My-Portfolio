            except Exception as e:
                results[check.__name__] = {'status': 'error', 'message': str(e)}
        
        # Generate compliance report
        await self.generate_compliance_report(results)
        
        # Alert on failures
        failures = [k for k, v in results.items() if v.get('status') == 'fail']
        if failures:
            await self.send_compliance_alert(failures)
    
    async def check_retention_compliance(self):
        # Check for data past retention period
        expired_data = await self.db.execute("""
            SELECT COUNT(*) FROM applications 
            WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '7 years'
            AND deletion_date IS NULL
        """)
